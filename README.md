## 🎯 Features
- **Grave System for Players**  
When players die, their items and XP are safely stored in a Grave so they don't despawn.

####

- **Grave-Info Command**  
Players can easily check the location of their graves, helping them recover items without wandering aimlessly.

####

- **Admin Grave Management**  
Admins can list, inspect, teleport to, or remove graves. This makes it easy to help players or keep the world clean from abandoned graves.

####

- **Configurable Grave Behavior**  
Decide whether Graves can be looted by other players, how much XP gets stored in them, and more.
